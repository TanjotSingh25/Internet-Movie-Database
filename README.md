## Description:

This website is an online movie searching database. This website is used to search data about any movie on IMDb (Pretty much every movie). This website uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and RISC API model to present all the data efficiently and impressively. Not only data, this website also enables users to search and download any movie's posters and stills as well.

## Key Features:

* Index page has a cool mouse hover effect where when you move your mouse, it fades in and fades out a movie poster from IMDb current top 100 most popular movies. I used IMDb API and RISC Javascript model to implement this.
* Since the posters are from an API, its real time data so it changes with time and is not static.
* The index page also has a neon flickering sign welcoming the user made usign CSS.
* Moving onto the next page, the user is presented with a search bar from where he can search any movie he wants.
* Below the search bar are also some suggestions movies that are popular right now (shown using API).
* We also have 2 options while searching, data or images. Selecting data will show user movie data (synopsis, release date, cast, trailer etc) and selecting images will show the user all the posters and stills from the searched movie.
* All the pages have navigation between them and we can get to anypage from one page.
